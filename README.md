Create a Windows application for purchasing floor covering. All the length and width (feet and inches) to be entered.
Be sure to include program statements that will keep your program from crashing if the end user enters non-numeric characters for the room dimensions.
Have a control that displays different floor covering types along with the prices of floor covering.
Using a tab control, provide selections such as Hardwood, Carpet and Laminate. On each tab allow the user to select a type and show prices.
Include, for example, options like Oak, Maple, Walnut and Cherry Hardwood floors with prices per square yard. Make up your own prices.
After the users enter the room dimensions and selects the floor covering and price, display the total cost to cover the room.
Include a checkbox to include the labor for covering the floor or uncheck if they want to do the work themselves. Labor runs $30.00 per square yard.
Include a button to clear the options and reset the forms.
